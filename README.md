# Formula_One_Analysis

When analyzing the data we found there was a lot of inconsistencies and dirty data so we had to be careful in selecting datasets to use when creating the dataframes.

We found merging csvâ€™s was useful to pull certain columns in separate dataframes to help us plot exactly what we were attempting to achieve with our questions.

Our questions we originally came up with had to be altered to fit the dataframes we could use for the information to be efficient.
